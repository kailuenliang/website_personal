        <h1>Para-Seedlings</h1>
        <div><strong>Year:</strong> 2024</div>
        <div><strong>Description:</strong> 3-channel Video and Sound Installation: Wood box, Speaker Surface Transducer, Packet of Winter Melon Seeds, Sunflower Seeds, Melon Seeds, Assorted Beans. Stable Diffusion - LORA on custom dataset.</div>
        
        <div class="project-description">
            <p>In the summer of 2020, packets of seeds started arriving into US mailboxes. They mostly came packaged with Chinese characters and customs labels marked as earrings, trinkets, and various other items. People all over the country had been going through various stages of lockdown for months and these mysterious and unsolicited seeds began appearing randomly. Of course in good social media fashion, places like reddit and 4chan became breeding grounds for all sorts of wild theories about these seeds.</p>

            <p>Para-Seedlings is a documentation of what happened to these seeds after arriving in the United States. The stages of growth watered by Orientalist technobabble. These seeds have multiplied and spread, sprouting AI seed faces that were then deep faked with selfies of the artist.</p>

            <p>These seeds are invasive, but non-toxic. They are everywhere but rarely ever seen. They are fake shanzhai in the global seed trade. They are imagined. They are real and growing. Grown from machine learning models, global migration, orientalist fears and fantasies, and a geopolitics founded on profit, anxiety and overwork.</p>
